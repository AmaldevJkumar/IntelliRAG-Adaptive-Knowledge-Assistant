> **An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that I built to demonstrate enterprise-scale AI engineering capabilities, combining cutting-edge language models with intelligent document retrieval for accurate, contextual, and transparent AI responses.**
**IntelliRAG is a practical, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that delivers accurate, source-grounded answers from private and public documents using modern LLMs and vector search. It ingests documents, breaks them into semantically meaningful chunks, embeds those chunks in a vector database, retrieves the most relevant passages for a query, and generates concise answers with citations and confidence indicators.**

---

## What the project does
- Ingests multi-format content (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, HTML), extracts, cleans, and semantically chunks it.
- Builds dense vector indices with modern embeddings; supports semantic, keyword, and hybrid retrieval.
- Reranks candidates (e.g., cross-encoder) to improve precision before answer generation.
- Generates answers grounded in retrieved context with citations, optional streaming, and confidence scoring.
- Provides monitoring hooks (latency, confidence, retrieval quality) and deployment scaffolding for small teams and enterprise operations.

## Why it's useful
- Reduces hallucination by grounding answers in trusted sources.
- Keeps knowledge current without retraining—update documents, reindex, and go.
- Improves discoverability and productivity across research, engineering, and support.
- Adds transparency: every response cites its sources and reports a confidence score.

## Key features
- Document pipeline: extraction, cleaning, semantic chunking, embedding, vector indexing.
- Retrieval: semantic, keyword (BM25), and hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and reranking.
- Generation: multi-LLM provider support, streamed or complete answers, citations and confidence scoring.
- Monitoring and evaluation: performance and quality metrics, dashboards, alerts, and evaluation hooks.
- Security and operations: JWT auth, RBAC scaffolding, rate limiting, audit logging, Docker/Kubernetes-ready.

## My journey building IntelliRAG

This project reflects a learning and engineering path developed during the MSc in Data Science at the University of Glasgow. The programme's blend of computing foundations, machine learning, information retrieval, and a substantial project component provided the theoretical and practical grounding to design and ship a real system. Through lectures, labs, and project-based modules, core skills formed the backbone of this work: data engineering, IR and retrievers, deep learning, software architecture, and evaluation.

Curiosity was the catalyst. Large language models are transformative, yet they can hallucinate and fall behind real-world changes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a pragmatic pattern: let LLMs reason, but retrieve truth from trusted, up-to-date sources. Building IntelliRAG was the opportunity to move from theory to production-quality software—making deliberate design choices about chunking, indexing, hybrid retrieval, reranking, prompt construction, evaluation, and monitoring.

What this taught and reinforced:
- How to structure a FastAPI codebase for clarity and scale.
- How chunking and hybrid retrieval trade precision and recall.
- How to surface the quality and performance metrics stakeholders actually need.
- How to package, test, and deploy with CI/CD and container orchestration.
- How to design for reliability, observability, and ongoing improvement.

IntelliRAG is both a working system and a capstone artifact—evidence of translating MSc learning outcomes into robust, maintainable, and deployable AI software.

## Architecture overview

- Ingestion: Multi-format text extraction → cleaning → semantic chunking.
- Embeddings: Batch encode chunks → store vectors in FAISS/Pinecone/Weaviate.
- Retrieval: Semantic + keyword retrieval → RRF fusion → cross-encoder reranking.
- Generation: Assemble context → LLM answer → cite sources → estimate confidence.
- Monitoring: Track latency, confidence, retrieval quality; dashboards and alerts.
- Deployment: Docker images; Kubernetes manifests for scale, resilience, and rollout.
