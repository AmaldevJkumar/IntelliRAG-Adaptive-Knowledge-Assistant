# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
   - Classification: Predicting categories
   - Regression: Predicting continuous values

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without labels
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
   - Association: Finding relationships between variables

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback
   - Agent learns through trial and error
   - Maximizes rewards while minimizing penalties

## Common Algorithms

### Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformer Architecture

## Applications

Machine learning is widely used in:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
